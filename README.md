# migueldavid-zsh-theme
My ZSH theme inspired by mrtazz and alanpeabody

I wanted an uncluterred Z shell theme that still had basic information like:
- who am I
- which machine am I at
- where am I

So, not finding anything that I liked and that did not require me to download corrected fonts, I created this one from a mix of mrtazz and alanpeabody's.

Feel free to pull, send issues, etc. And enjoy.
